#For box E, we have uniqueness of the underlying gaussian correlation, as the box-probability
#is a CDF, and hence is a tetrachroic. [FIRST STEP, verify this]

#For box H, we need not have uniqueness of its box-probability, but we have uniqueness
#from a restriction of its CDF at its upper right corner. 

#We wish to construct a distribution with the right box-probability.
#Since G is already fixed, the "sum-distribution" with the G-box and an H
#box with a probability fixed by the CDF at the upper right corner
#at H will also have the right
